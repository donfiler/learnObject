# learnObject
Sample application created with the help of PHP-Academy's tutorial (Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfdtiltiRHWF5Rhuk7k4UAU1_yLAZzhWc)

This repo contains all the files that were taught in the tutorial. I started taking this tutorial and in the end I was very happy that I got to learn about object oriented programming. Hope this will provide some reference who are following the same tutorial.
